# Soar

Soar is the Stacker node agent: a maintained fork of Pterodactyl Wings that
keeps the Wings container API compatible while adding first-class node database
services and authenticated self-updates.

Soar manages MariaDB, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, and Redis through Docker. Database
operations live under the protected `/api/soar/databases` namespace and use the
same node token as the rest of the daemon. Every provisioned database gets a
dedicated user limited to that database. All four engines are installed and
health-checked automatically; failed services expose a redacted diagnostic and
are periodically reconciled without blocking the container API.

The protected `POST /api/soar/update` endpoint installs the newest published
Soar release after validating its SHA-256 checksum, then restarts `soar.service`.

## Upstream

Soar is based on [Pterodactyl Wings](https://github.com/pterodactyl/wings) and
retains its MIT license and attribution. The upstream documentation below still
applies to the compatible container-management API.

## Pterodactyl Wings

Wings is Pterodactyl's server control plane, built for the rapidly changing gaming industry and designed to be
highly performant and secure. Wings provides an HTTP API allowing you to interface directly with running server
instances, fetch server logs, generate backups, and control all aspects of the server lifecycle.

In addition, Wings ships with a built-in SFTP server allowing your system to remain free of Pterodactyl specific
dependencies, and allowing users to authenticate with the same credentials they would normally use to access the Panel.
